    "- `new_material` itself will involve a whole array of things: doing an online tutorial, watching a lecture, following a class and whatnot. It doesn't make much sense to make it less than 45 minutes, because preparing for a learning session and getting focused takes time so you shouldn't change focus that often. It doesn't make sense to make it longer, as after 90 minutes it's easy for the learning process to become inefficient.\n",
    "- `flashcards_prep` is an understanding-focused activity. When you learn new material you should also prepare your images to be used downstream in a flashcard. As you will use flashcards on your phone, the simplest way to go is to use screenshots if you're on your phone and brute-force phone-made photos of bits of computer screen otherwise (yes, the quality will suck a bit, and just taking a screenshots on a laptop is an option, but then you have to remember to export them to your phone to appropriate folders and the whole thing becomes annoying). So: **when you go through new material and see some bits where you think, yes, this seems like something general enough for me to remember, take a picture with your phone**. At the beginning of your `flashcards_prep` session, simply take a look at your last pictures, move them to topic-  or online-class focused folders and then use them to add a few flashcards to the corresponding subfolder in Anki, simply using the pics from your folder. An alternative, potentially, would be to use Anki on your laptop as well and then copy-paste code or whatnot, but this again becomes annoying very fast and then you have to synch with your phone, and this becomes too unwieldy to be worth the effort. **Crucially, every time you add an image to Anki, first take a careful look, make sure you can explain to yourself what you see on this image and carefully think about the question you want Anki to ask you when it asks you about that image.**\n",
    "- `flashcards_review` is basically what it says. Once you have a bunch of Anki cards, make sure you spend 15-20 minutes daily testing yourself. Anki will take care of frequency and choosing the cards to ask you. The key idea is you don't want to work on the same thing in a row, so if you do one folder today, do another tomorrow etc.\n",
    "- `fluff` is additional stuff, like, figuring out how to install and use Anki, reading a blog about learning or about programming, listening to a podcast about learning to code, setting up some online course for yourself etc."
