# Welcome to Code Up!

This is a selection of online stepwise materials that I will be developing for the love of my life who decided to 
try to move with me between continents, with all the fuss that comes with it. In the process, this required her to 
quit her job and think hard about what she wants to do in the new place. One thing that she decided to try getting into
coding, so this will be my best take at trying to advice her in the beginning of the path of trying this out.

In short, the content of this will be highly personalized and most likely useless to anyone else. 

G., I love you.
