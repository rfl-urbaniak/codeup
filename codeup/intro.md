# Welcome to Code Up!

This is a selection of online stepwise materials that I will be developing for the love of my life who decided to 
be with me even across continents, with all the fuss that comes with it. One thing that she decided to try getting into
coding, so this will be my best take at trying to advice her in the beginning of the path of trying this out.

In short, the content of this will be highly personalized and most likely useless to anyone else. 

G., I love you. 

P.S. The side image is a good metaphor here - someone amazing looking curiously at a strange world with things that might look like annoying monsters but probably aren't.
