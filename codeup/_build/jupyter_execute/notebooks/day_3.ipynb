To avoid imbalance, and to make sure you do spend enough time studying on a daily basis, and to motivate yourself by seeing how your work investment grows, track your time. The easiest way is to do this is to install a simple free time tracker and add projects to the tracking. The data will also allow you to build cool plots later on. :)\n",
